# JavaUtils
## About:
JavaUtils is a collection of small useful Java utility functions that extend the core functionality of Java.  
These utility functions are inspired by functions that are in C# but not in Java. It is also where I got most of my inspiration from.
## Features:  
- ConsoleUtils:
  - Allows you to easily do multiple things relating to input & output at the same time.
- ParseUtils:
  - Allows you to safely parse types without any chance of errors.
